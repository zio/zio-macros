Scrap boilerplate in your ZIO projects.

This project is a loose collection of different macro-based solutions to simplify your code. Head to the specific docs to
learn more about the ones that interest you.

- [accessible](docs/accessible.md) - Generate public accessors for ZIO services.
- [mockable](docs/mockable.md) - Automatically derive mockable implementations for your services.

## Installation

The macros have been split into two subprojects.

- `zio-macros-core` has no dependencies other than `zio`, it contains _accessible_, _delegate_ and _mix_

```scala
"dev.zio" %% "zio-macros-core" % "<version>"
```

- `zio-macros-test` depends on `zio-test` and `zio-macros-core`, it contains _mockable_

```scala
"dev.zio" %% "zio-macros-test" % "<version>"
```

As this project is heavily using macros you will need to enable them:

- If using a scala version < 2.13 you need to add the macro paradise compiler plugin.

```scala
compilerPlugin(("org.scalamacros" % "paradise"  % "2.1.1") cross CrossVersion.full)
```

- If using scala 2.13 you need to add the macro annotation compiler options.
```scala
scalacOptions += "-Ymacro-annotations"
```
